     <h2>Tourist Spots</h2>
    
         <ul>
             <li>Boracay, Western Visayas</li>
               <p> It is a small island in the Philippines, and it is known for its infamous resorts and 
                  beaches. Offshore, coral reefs and shipwrecks are home to diverse marine life. A trip to the beach is not your basic sun tanning and swimming -
                  there is more to that! You can go island hopping with your friends, ATV riding, parasail to feel like a bird, scuba dive, swim with the whalesharks, and be a mermaid. Yup, you heard it, mermaid. They have mermaid tail rentals, 
                  that you can use for photoshoots, and lessons that they offer. Be mezmerized as unique and intricate sandcastles are formed right in front
                  of you! At night, local fire dancers illuminate the dancefloor. For Boracay's accomodations,

            <li>Vigan Historic City, Vigan</li>
               <p> A historical city that treasures the traditional infrastructures during the Spanish colonial era.
                 It has many baroque-styled Cathedrals, and traditional Filipino vintage houses that were influenced by the Spaniards. You can
                 observe weavers weave abel cloth - a tradition that is passed on to generations. 
                 Vigan also has antique souvenirs you can take home 
                 aside from the abel cloth - vintage jewelry, furniture, keychains, and more! Try their longganisa, a sausage influenced by the Spanish, and 
                 experience the Longganisa Festival. For accomodations,

               <p> Declared as on of the seven wonders of the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Puerto Princesa's underground river should be one of your stops. On a boat with your friends, 
              a tour guide will lead you to see the unique formations of the cave, and bats that inhabit it. This site has a second floor, meaning that 
              there are small waterfalls inside the cave. Be amazed by the wonder of the world's longest underground river. For accomodations, <href="http://www.gopalawan.travel/Underground_River_Tour">click here</a></p>

                     but has ice cream, mung beans, flan, agar jellies, wafer sticks - anything you can think of. Well, the literal meaning of "halo-halo" is actually

                     However, Filipinos do not only eat the pig, but pair it with some sweet sauce, rice, and sometimes other food.

                     a daredevil, you must prove yourself to be a real one by trying this grotesque delicacy.
