     <h2>Tourist Spots</h2>
    
         <ul>
             <li>Boracay, Western Visayas</li>
               <p> It is a small island in the Philippines, and it is known for its infamous resorts and 
                  beaches. Offshore, coral reefs and shipwrecks are home to diverse marine life. A trip to the beach is not your basic sun tanning and swimming -
                  there is more to that! You can go island hopping with your friends, ATV riding, parasail to feel like a bird, scuba dive, swim with the whalesharks, and be a mermaid. Yup, you heard it, mermaid. They have mermaid tail rentals, 
                  that you can use for photoshoots, and lessons that they offer. For Boracay's accomodations,

            <li>Vigan Historic City, Vigan</li>
               <p> A historical city that treasures the traditional infrastructures during the Spanish colonial era.
                 It has many baroque-styled Cathedrals, and traditional Filipino vintage houses that were influenced by the Spaniards. You can
                 observe weavers weave abel cloth - a tradition that is passed on to generations. 
                 Vigan also has antique souvenirs you can take home 
                 aside from the abel cloth - vintage jewelry, furniture, keychains, and more! For accomodations,
