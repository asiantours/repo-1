               Baba Ghanoush:
                  If you like hummus, baba ghanoush is a must-try. It's a dip that's served with pita bread and drizzled with 
                  olive oil. It tastes very similar to hummus because it's made with tahini. Main difference is that baba ghanoush
                  is made from eggplant instead of chickpeas and sometimes pomegranate. 
              </div>
              <div class="box 2">
                Manakeesh:
                  This cuisine is like lebanese pizza. It can be made with meat, cheese, zaatar (which is a strain of thyme), or 
                  kishik (a cracked wheat paste). Manakeesh is typically served with tomatoes, cucumbers, fresh mint leaves and olives.
              </div>
              <div class="box 3">
                  Falafel:

                  tahini sauce. (the same sauce they put in hummus and baba ghanoush)
