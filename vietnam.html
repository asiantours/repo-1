        caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot. The highlight for most people though,
        is simply cruising and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

        buzzing and crazy commercial hub of the country. 
    <li>Hue</li>
      - One of Vietnam's most historic towns, is packed tothe brim with relics from the reign of the 19th-century
        Nguyen emperors. Sitting along the banks of the gorgeous Perfume River, the Imperial Enclosure is a huge 
        site set within walls that sprawl for 2.5 kilometers
