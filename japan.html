              delicious cuisine and authentic accommodations. The Kumano Kodo is the name of the hiking route made up of 
              seven trails that snake through the Kii Mountain Range in Japan's Wakayama prefecture. It's about 100 km south of Osaka.

           - This is a place that is recommneded for sure! The parks in Tokyo is a beautiful sight. Many parks you could go to are:
        ~ Ueno Park: One of Japan's most crowded, noisy and popular spots to view the cherry blossoms! This park features more 
        than 1000 trees along the street leading towards the National Museum around Shinobazu Pond. 
        ~ Meguro River: This park has about 800 cherry trees that line MEguro River for several hundred meters and create an amazing
        sight. However, as a concrete canal, Meguro River does not offer a very natural surrounding for blossom viewers.
        
        4. Universal Studios Japan
